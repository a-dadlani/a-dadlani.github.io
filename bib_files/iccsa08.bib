abstract="Quality of service (QoS) differentiation within the optical infrastructure is under constant development due to the direct impact of the ever-rising demand for time-critical and multimedia applications in the Internet. In this paper, we propose an efficient prioritized hybrid model based on two eminent approaches namely, resource-reservation and extra offset-time based QoS that have already been investigated in the literature. We show that this model guarantees better performance with increase in number of traffic classes. We also simulate a complete topologically optical network bearing Poisson traffic to assess the performance of the proposed model as compared with the two aforementioned approaches.",
