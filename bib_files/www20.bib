abstract = {Podcast listeners have tripled over the past 5 years to over 100 million subscribers inside the US alone. Yet, no research study has focused on obtaining insights into the growth and popularity of contents among the subscribers. In this paper, we investigate the main factors that contribute to the popularity of podcasts. Our study helps content producers, service providers, and investors to better understand the rationales behind the popularity of podcasts.},
