abstract="The need for supporting the ever-growing number of multi-computers in the contemporary Internet has persuaded researches worldwide to search for suitable underlying network topologies with desirable properties. Even in the presence of speedy optical technologies, the arrangement of nodes in a network can be highly influential. Among all the topologies investigated so far, k -ary n-cubes have been reported to be widely adopted in the literature. But in hybrid networks, where the network is composed of a mixture of different types of topologies, the type and size of k-ary n-cubes can greatly affect the performance factor of the network. In this paper, we study and compare the performance behaviour of simple regular meshes with their wrap-around variants (2-D and 3-D torus) for Optical Packet Switching (OPS) systems with various sizes under a common traffic condition through simulation results.",
